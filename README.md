Basic OCR and Text Extraction

This GitHub project explores the fundamentals of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and demonstrates how to extract text from images using Python.
Key Features:

    OCR Implementation: Learn how to use Tesseract OCR to extract text from images.
    Text Extraction Techniques: Explore various methods to process images and extract meaningful text data.
    Language Translation: Includes functionality to translate text from Czech to English using TextBlob.

Projects Overview:

This projects provides a hands-on introduction to OCR techniques, making it accessible for beginners to understand and implement text extraction functionalities. The code is well-documented and can serve as a foundation for building more advanced OCR applications.
Technologies Used:

    Python
    Tesseract OCR
    Pillow (PIL)
    TextBlob
   
Snipping Tool: Explore a custom Snipping Tool application built with PyQt5 and Python, enabling users to capture specific regions of the screen for further processing.
Image Preprocessing Techniques: Dive into image preprocessing methods such as Gaussian Blur and Thresholding to enhance image quality and prepare them for text extraction.
Text Extraction using OCR: Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from preprocessed images, enabling automated data extraction from documents, images, and videos.
Language Translation: Extend the capabilities of text extraction by integrating language translation services, allowing for multilingual text recognition and translation.

Key Features:

    Snipping Tool: Capture precise regions of the screen.
    Image Preprocessing: Reduce noise and enhance text visibility.
    Text Extraction with OCR: Recognize and extract text from images.
    Language Translation: Translate extracted text into multiple languages.
